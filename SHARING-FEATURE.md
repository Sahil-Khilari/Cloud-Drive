# üì§ File Sharing Feature - Documentation

## Overview

The file sharing feature allows users to securely share their uploaded files with other users who have Gmail accounts. All shared files are tracked in Firestore and remain accessible even after the app is closed and reopened.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Share Files
- Click the "Share" button on any uploaded file
- Enter the recipient's Gmail address
- Files are instantly shared with the recipient

### ‚úÖ Gmail Validation
- Only Gmail addresses (@gmail.com) are accepted
- Real-time email format validation
- Prevents sharing with yourself

### ‚úÖ Shared Files Dashboard
- **Received Tab**: View files others have shared with you
- **Sent Tab**: View files you've shared with others
- Real-time updates when new files are shared
- Shows sender/recipient information

### ‚úÖ Persistent Storage
- All files are permanently stored in Firebase
- Files remain available after closing/reopening the app
- Shared files are tracked in Firestore database
- User authentication ensures secure access

## How It Works

### Database Structure

#### `files` Collection
Stores uploaded files with the following fields:
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated",
  name: "document.pdf",
  url: "https://firebase-storage-url...",
  size: 1048576, // bytes
  type: "application/pdf",
  userId: "owner-user-id",
  userEmail: "owner@gmail.com",
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

#### `shares` Collection
Tracks file shares with the following fields:
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated",
  fileId: "reference-to-file-id",
  fileName: "document.pdf",
  fileUrl: "https://firebase-storage-url...",
  fileSize: 1048576,
  fileType: "application/pdf",
  ownerId: "owner-user-id",
  ownerEmail: "owner@gmail.com",
  recipientEmail: "recipient@gmail.com",
  sharedAt: Timestamp
}
```

### Security Rules

#### Firestore Rules
- Users can only read their own files
- Users can only create files with their own userId
- Users can read shares where they are owner OR recipient
- Users can only create shares for files they own
- Users can only delete their own shares

#### Storage Rules
- Files are stored at `/files/{userId}/{fileName}`
- Users can only access files in their own folder
- 50MB file size limit enforced
- Authentication required for all operations

### Firestore Queries

#### Get Received Files
```javascript

  collection(db, 'shares'),
  where('recipientEmail', '==', user.email.toLowerCase()),
  orderBy('sharedAt', 'desc')
)
```

#### Get Sent Files
```javascript
query(
  collection(db, 'shares'),
  where('ownerEmail', '==', user.email.toLowerCase()),
  orderBy('sharedAt', 'desc')
)
```

#### Get All Shares (Received + Sent)
```javascript
query(
  collection(db, 'shares'),
  or(
    where('recipientEmail', '==', user.email.toLowerCase()),
    where('ownerEmail', '==', user.email.toLowerCase())
  ),
  orderBy('sharedAt', 'desc')
)
```

### Real-Time Updates

All file lists use Firestore's `onSnapshot` listener for real-time updates:
- New files appear instantly when uploaded
- Shared files appear instantly when shared
- Deleted files disappear instantly
- No page refresh required

## Deployment Notes

### Required Firestore Indexes

The following composite indexes are required:

1. **Shares by recipientEmail + sharedAt**
   ```
   Collection: shares
   Fields: recipientEmail (Ascending), sharedAt (Descending)
   ```

2. **Shares by ownerEmail + sharedAt**
   ```
   Collection: shares
   Fields: ownerEmail (Ascending), sharedAt (Descending)
   ```

These are automatically created when you deploy with:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

### Security Rules Deployment

Deploy updated Firestore rules:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## Limitations

## Troubleshooting

### Files Not Appearing After Refresh

**Issue**: Files disappear after closing and reopening the app

**Solution**: This shouldn't happen as files are stored permanently in Firestore. If it does:
1. Check if user is signed in with the same account
2. Verify Firestore rules are deployed
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure Firebase SDK is properly initialized

### Cannot Share Files

**Issue**: Share button doesn't work or shows errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify recipient email is a valid Gmail address
2. Check Firestore rules allow creating shares
3. Ensure you're not sharing with yourself
4. Check for duplicate shares with same recipient
5. Verify internet connection

### Shared Files Not Showing

**Issue**: Shared files don't appear in "Received" tab

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you're signed in with the Gmail account that received the share
2. Check if sender used correct email address
3. Refresh the page
4. Check Firestore console to verify share record exists
5. Verify Firestore indexes are deployed

### Email Validation Failing

**Issue**: Valid Gmail addresses are rejected

**Solution**: 
- Email must be exactly in format: `user@gmail.com`
- No spaces before or after
- All lowercase is recommended
- No special characters except `.`, `_`, `+`, `-` before @
